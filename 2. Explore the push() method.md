# 2. Explore the push() method

Using the Array class you just created above, add an item to the array. Use the following function:

````
function main(){

    Array.SIZE_RATIO = 3;

    // Create an instance of the Array class
    let arr = new Array();

    // Add an item to the array
    arr.push(3);

    console.log(arr);
}
````

What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array?
```{ length: 1, _capacity: 3, ptr: 0 }```

Add the following in the main function and then print the array:

```
    ...
    arr.push(5);  //Array { length: 2, _capacity: 3, ptr: 0 }
    arr.push(15); //Array { length: 3, _capacity: 3, ptr: 0 }
    arr.push(19); //Array { length: 4, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 }
    arr.push(45); //Array { length: 5, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 } 
    arr.push(10); //Array { length: 6, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 }
 ```
What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array? Explain the result of your program after adding the new lines of code. 
```
Array { length: 6, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 }
```
//The array had to resize 3X
