# 3. Exploring the pop() method

Add the following in the main function and then print the array:
- What is the length, capacity, and address of your array? Explain the result of your program after adding the new lines of code.

````
... 
arr.pop(); //Array { length: 5, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 }
arr.pop(); //Array { length: 4, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 } 
arr.pop(); //Array { length: 3, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 } 
````



The length decreases, but the memory size does not shrink
