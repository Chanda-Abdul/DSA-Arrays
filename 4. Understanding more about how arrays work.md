# 4. Understanding more about how arrays work

#### Print the 1st item in the array arr.
```console.log(arr[0], "first item in array")```
undefined

#### Empty the array and add just 1 item: arr.push("tauhida");
```
arr.pop();
arr.pop();
arr.pop();
```

```
arr.push("tauhida"
```

### Print this 1 item that you just added. What is the result? Can you explain your result?
```console.log(arr[0])```

````Array { length: 1, _capacity: 12, ptr: 3 }````

#### What is the purpose of the _resize() function in your Array class?

To increase the size of the memory in order to have space that can be allocated as new items are added to the array class
