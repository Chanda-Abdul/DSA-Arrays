8. Merge arrays

Imagine you have 2 arrays which have already been sorted. Write an algorithm to merge the 2 arrays into a single array, which should also be sorted.

Input:[1, 3, 6, 8, 11] and [2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10] Output:[1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 8, 8, 9, 10, 11]

````
function merge(arr1, arr2) {
 let output = []
 let index1 = 0 
 let index2 = 0
 let current = 0
 while(current< (arr1.length + arr2.length)) {
   let depleated1 = (index1 >= arr1.length)
   let depleated2 = (index2 >= arr2.length)  
   
   //if next item comes from arr1
   if(!depleated1 && (depleated2 || (arr1[index1] < arr2[index2]))) {
     output.push(arr1[index1])
     index1++
   } else {
     output.push(arr2[index2])
     index2++
   }
   current++
 }
  return output
}

merge([1, 3, 6, 8, 11], [2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10])
