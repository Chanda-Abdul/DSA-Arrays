# 9. Remove characters

Write an algorithm that deletes given characters from a string. For example, given a string of "Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny" and the characters to be removed are "aeiou", the algorithm should transform the original string to "Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny". Do not use Javascript's filter, split, or join methods.

Input:'Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny', 'aeiou' Output: 'Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny'

````
function removeChar(string, chars) {
 let output = ''
 for (let i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
   let contained = true;
   for (let j = 0; j < chars.length; j++) {
     if (string[i] === chars[j]) {
       contained = false
     }
   }
   if (contained) {
     output += string[i]
   }
 }
  return output
}

removeChar("Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny", "aeiou")

This function has a polynomial time complexity of O(n^2) because of the 2 nested loops
